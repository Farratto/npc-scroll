Fantasy Grounds extension for the 5E ruleset that enables using the mouse wheel
to change the some "offense" abilities in the combat tracker.

### How to

On the combat tracker, while holding the **Ctrl** key and hovering an Offence ability, use the mouse
wheel to increment or decrement either:
- the attack bonus;
- the number of damage or healing dice;
- the save DC;
- the recharge dice.

Hold the **Alt** key and use the mouse wheel to cycle through:
- the damage and healing die type (d4, d6, d8, d10 or d12);
- the saving throw's ability (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha).
