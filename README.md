# CT Scroll

Fantasy Grounds extension for the 5E ruleset that enables using the mouse wheel
to change the some "offense" abilities in the combat tracker.

### How to

On the combat tracker, while holding the **Ctrl** key and hovering an Offence
ability, use the mouse wheel to increment or decrement either:
- the attack bonus;
- the number of damage or healing dice;
- the save DC;
- the recharge dice.

Hold the **Alt** key and use the mouse wheel to cycle through:
- the damage and healing die type (d4, d6, d8, d10 or d12);
- the saving throw's ability (str, dex, con, int, wis, cha).

### Automatic cantrip increment for spellcasters

When added to the CT, NPC's with the "Spellcasting" trait will have their
cantrip's DMG and HEAL die expressions automatically incremented based on their
spellcasting level. Dice count is incremented once if 5th-level or above, twice
starting at 11th-level and three times after 17th.
